<h2>About me</h2>

<p>
  I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the 
  <a href="https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">Siebel School of Computing and Data Science</a> 
  (formerly the Department of Computer Science) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). 
  I am also a member of the 
  <a href="http://iacoma.cs.uiuc.edu/" target="_blank">i-acoma</a> research group, 
  advised by 
  <a href="http://iacoma.cs.uiuc.edu/josep/torrellas.html" target="_blank">Prof. Josep Torrellas</a>.
</p>

<p>
  My research focuses on <b>fault-tolerant, high-performance data center systems</b> that leverage 
  <b>Compute Express Link (CXL)</b> for shared-memory and disaggregated architectures. 
  I am broadly interested in <b>Computer Architecture</b>, <b>Distributed Systems</b>, and 
  <b>High-Performance Computing</b>, with work spanning consistency and persistency models, 
  as well as <b>RDMA-based communication</b> to enable efficient data transfers, 
  distributed transactions, and recovery mechanisms.
</p>

<p>
  I earned both my <b>B.Sc. (2017)</b> and <b>M.Sc. (2019)</b> in Computer Science from the 
  <a href="https://www.csd.uoc.gr/CSD/index.jsp" target="_blank">University of Crete (UOC)</a>, 
  and I’m originally from <b>Heraklion, Crete, Greece</b>.
