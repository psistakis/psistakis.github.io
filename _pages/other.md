## Poetry and Quotes

A curated selection of poetry, excerpts, and reflections that resonate with me.  
These pieces revolve around responsibility, humanity, and the journey of life.

### **1) Responsibility**

> *"Love responsibility. Say: It is my duty, and mine alone, to save the earth.  
> If it is not saved, then I alone am to blame."*  
> — **Nikos Kazantzakis**, *Ascesis* (1927)

### **2) Humanity as the Solution**

> *"In our gradually shrinking world, everyone is in need of all the others.  
> We must look for man wherever we can find him.  
> When on his way to Thebes Oedipus encountered the Sphinx, his answer to its riddle was: ‘Man’.  
> That simple word destroyed the monster."*  
> — **Giorgos Seferis**, Nobel Prize Banquet Speech (1963)

### **3) Ithaka**

> *"As you set out for Ithaka  
> hope the voyage is a long one,  
> full of adventure, full of discovery.  
> Laistrygonians, Cyclops,  
> angry Poseidon—don’t be afraid of them:  
> you’ll never find things like that on your way  
> as long as you keep your thoughts raised high,  
> as long as a rare excitement  
> stirs your spirit and your body."*  
> — **Konstantinos Kavafis**, *Ithaka* (1975)
